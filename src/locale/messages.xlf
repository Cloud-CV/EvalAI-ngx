        <source>With EvalAI, we want to standardize the process of
					evaluating different methods on a dataset and make it simple to host a competition.
					Comparing a new method with other existing approaches is an essential component of
					research and this process has traditionally been affected by difference in evaluation
					metric implementation, different splits of the dataset or minor modifications in the
					algorithm. This makes it extremely hard to reproduce numbers from published papers
					and reliably compare your method with other existing approaches. By building EvalAI, we
					hope to make this easier by standardizing the dataset splits, evaluation metrics and by
					maintaining a public leaderboard of hosted challenges.</source>
