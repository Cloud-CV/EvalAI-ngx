# CODE STRUCTURE

## Directory structure

The URL structure of the project can be found [below](#url structure).
The directory structure of `src/` looks like this:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ services
â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ fonts
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ images
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ get_involved
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ partners
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ rules
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ testimonials
â”œâ”€â”€ environments
â””â”€â”€ styles
``` 
It can be seen that the top level directories in the `src` folder are:
- `app` - This contains the main app component and houses all the components and services
	- `components` - Contains all the components (Views for all pages & Reusable components). See [section](#components) below. 
	- `services` - Contains all the injectable services that contain common functionalities.
		- _auth.service.ts_ - Authentication functions
		- _api.service.ts_ - Api call functions
		- _challenge.service.ts_ - Challenge related functions
		- _global.service.ts_ - Global common functionality
		- _window.service.ts_ - DOM specific functions
- `assets` - Contains static assets like fonts, images etc.
- `environments` - Contains API paths for `dev`, `staging` and `prod` environments.
- `styles` - Contains common style files which can be imported in the components.
	- _mixins.scss_ - Contains reusable mixins for screen sizes, box-shadow, gradients and keyframes.
	- _variables.scss_ - Contains color codes, screen sizes and font-weights .
	- _base.scss_ - Contains styles for buttons, tables, cards, modals, stylish-checkbox etc.

Each leaf in this tree is a component. Each of this is a folder which contains these respective files _layout_ - `html`, _style_ - `scss`, _logic_ - `ts` and _test_ - `spec.ts`.
